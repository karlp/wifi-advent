Plug in to USB / put in a battery.
The battery I included aren't great, but they last for a couple of hours.
They will recharge from USB.  There's a red/green light on the front that
is green when they're fully charged, and red when they're charging.

When it's powered up, it will scroll some green lights a bit, and then
you will get a wifi hotspot active.  You can ignore this completely and
just leave it, the default light pattern will work ok.

If you connect to the wifi hotspot (ssid and password on sticker) you can choose
to connect it your home wifi. (Top option)

Once that's done, you should be able to visit http://<ssid>.local and get a
bit more menu.

The software's nowhere near finished unfortunately.  On the "config" page, you
can choose three led patterns:

0: the default, reddish candley
1: fast random scrolling
2: random fade in

The "Updates" page is where one day you'll get a firmware update that will let you
have a lot more control over the lights, and be able to send messages to the other lights.
